# Development

## Schema Versions

The version of the data schema is stored in `schemaVersion`, allowing for systematic migrations. See SCHEMA_* constants for specific version information.

## Tunneling Localhost

Localhost can be tunneled to a public url for mobile testing purposes using ngrok.

To allow logins, the ngrok domain must be added to [Firebase Authorized Domains](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/em-proto/authentication/providers).

```sh
ngrok http 3333
```
