# Contributing Guidelines

## Functional Programming

Adhere to the functional programming style, namely no mutations.

- No `let`; use `const`
- No `for` loops; use `map`, `filter`, `reduce`

See existing code if you are unfamiliar with this approach. Support will be offered to those new to this style, but a willingness and effort is required. Do not claim an issue or submit a PR if you are unable or unwilling to adhere to this requirement.
